## The Odin Project

# Project: Weather app

**Live version** of the site can be found [here](https://vignesh0220.github.io/weather_app/)

This weather app gets the user's local coordinates through the Geolocation API and displays the weather data of that location. You can also search for the weather data of cities around the world.

This weather app displays the weather data of any city around the world! Just type whichever city in the search bar and the display will populate the data.

Features:

1. _*Get local weather data*_
   The app gets the user's location data on initialization if the user has location access turned on. The local weather will then be displayed shortly afterwards. If location access is disabled, the app defaults to London, UK.

2. _*Search for any city in the world*_
   The GeoDB cities API allows the app to get city data all over the world which is then used to display the local weather for that area. Search results are sorted by decreasing population order.

3. _*Get units in either metric or imperial*_
   You can get your weather data--including temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, etc.--in either metric or imperial units.
